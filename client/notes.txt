Our Values

Edify's engineering culture is as important to us as the skills of our developers. Being successful at Edify generally means that you feel aligned with these...

We value excellence!
Our team takes pride in their work and puts in the effort to build the very best product.

We own what we do!
Our customers rely on us to make their own businesses successful - if something doesn't work, we don't wait to be told; we fix it and move on to the next improvement.

We all drive!
We speak up when something's not right, ask for help when we're unsure and celebrate when we win (which is pretty often!).

We focus on the customer!
Sure, we're software engineers and our skills lie in our code, but we are constantly thinking about how our customers use Edify and prioritising their needs over our wants.

Simple beats everything!
There are many ways to solve problems, but we try hard not to over-engineer and instead think about the simplest solution and iterate.

Every change is an improvement!
We don't accept "move fast and break things" - everything we do makes our platform, the team or the code just a little better.

We learn from our mistakes!
When things go wrong, we're happy to jump in, put it right and then try and make sure it can't happen again.

We are confident in our creations!
Whatever our level, when we build things, we're confident in our ability to ship it to the customer problem-free.

Refactoring is in our DNA!
No system, process or codebase is perfect and we are happy to change things around to make it better.

Instruction is optional!
On our own, we take the initiative to make improvements. As a team, we support each other and build it even better
